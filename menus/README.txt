In this folder, we keep all python scripts that are responsible for displaying menus.
Each script has a main() function that needs to be called to display the menu.

__init__.py - Import all menu modules for easy importing from other files
pref.py - Handles preferences menu, also defines utility functions for loading and saving user preferences.
singleplayer.py - Handles singleplayer menu.
timer.py - Handles timer menu.
